        <h1>The Land Before Time</h1>

        <p>The Land Before Time is a childrens' series that started in 1988, comprised of dozens of movies and tv shows starring a group of young dinosaurs and their various adventures. As with most dinosaur media, especially older dinosaur media, there are many inaccuracies within the character designs of the main characters, which I will be pointing out in this page.</p>

                <p>Littlefoot is a young male Apatosaurus, or “Longneck” as they are known in the series. His brown colouring and frame are very accurate to real-life Apatosaurus, but his head, neck and tail are inaccurate. Scientists model the Apatosaurus as having a cone-shaped head, and its neck and tail each being just as long as, if not longer, than their main bodies. The neck and tail length could be attributed to the animation style, but the head is still inaccurate. Overall, Littlefoot is a mostly accurate depiction of an Apatosaurus. I rate him a 4/5.</p>

                <p>Cera is a young female Triceratops, or “Threehorn” as they are known in the series. Her colouring changes quite a lot over the series, ranging from light tan to bright orange, and none of the spectrum of colours she is portrayed as are accurate. Scientists model the Triceratops as being a much darker, gray-brown colour. Other than her colouring, her missing horns and low amount of spikes on her frill are much stranger discrepancies. Her frame is the only accurate attribute of her design. Overall, Cera is a very inaccurate depiction of a Triceratops. I rate her a 2/5.</p>

                <p>Ducky is a young female Saurolophus, or “Bigmouth” as they are known in the series. Her colouring is fairly accurate, but scientists seem to be torn on what colour the Saurolophus was, and their depictions vary. A good amount of scientific depictions show the Saurolophus as being green, so I’ll say that she’s accurate in this sense. Her frame is accurate, minus her feet. They’re plantigrade, meaning that she stands with her sole on the ground like humans. In reality, the Saurolophus had digitigrade feet, meaning that they stood on their toes like cats and dogs. Overall, other than that one discrepancy, Ducky is a very accurate depiction of a Saurolophus. I rate her a 4.5/5.</p>

                <p>Petrie is a young male Pteranodon, or “flyers” as they are known in the series. His colouring is mostly accurate, but his underwings should be a light orange and his underbelly should be a darker gray. His frame is fairly accurate, but there are some discrepancies. Scientific depictions of the Pteranodon show it having webbed back feet, and their “head horn” being a much longer and a brighter red. Overall, Petrie is a good depiction of a Pteranodon. I rate him a 4/10.</p>

                <p>Spike is a young male Stegosaurus, or “spiketails” as they are known in the series. His colouring is accurate, this brings up the issue of his missing back plates. While scientific depictions have changed over time, most now agree that the Stegosaurus starts off with small plates that grow in size over their lifetime, instead of hatching without them. Because this character debuted in the beginning of the series (The Land Before Time movie, 1988) when the scientific consensus was that Stegosaurus hatched without their spines, I will give this a pass. Overall, Spike is a good depiction of a Stegosaurus. I rate him a 4/5.</p>

                <p>Chomper is a young male Tyrannosaurus Rex, or “sharptooth” as they are known in the series. His colouring is clearly inaccurate, so I’m going to move on to his frame, which is a tricky topic. There aren’t many records of juvenile T.Rex fossils, so basing his frame off of a proportionately smaller T.Rex, his muzzle is too boxy. The T.Rex had a much rounder muzzle. Overall, while there wasn’t much to base critiques off of, Chomper is a bad depiction of a T.Rex. I rate him a 2/5.</p>

Her colouring, like Chomper’s, is clearly inaccurate, so I’m going to move on to her frame, which is very accurate, besides the shape of the head frill. Scientists have gone back and forth on whether the Oviraptor has feathers almost as long as they’ve known that it existed, so her feathers could go either way for accuracy. Overall, she is a decent depiction of an Oviraptor. I rate her a 3/5.</p>
